# BLOCKLIST

BLOCKLIST is an application that uses the blockchain.info API to find balance and transaction data on bitcoin addresses.

Simply enter a bitcoin address in the search field to see the data for that address.

### Code Examples
To access the data from the Blockchain API, when the "Find Address" button is clicked a fetch request is made combining the input bitcoin address with Blockchain's API address. Fetch was used because it's a web standard more modern than AJAX. Through promises, the fetch request updates the component's state with either the data or an error message.

```javascript
let searchURL = "https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/" + this.state.searchAddress;
fetch(searchURL, {
  method: 'GET',
  async: false,
  mode: "cors",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Origin": "",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*://*/*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type"
  }
}).then((data) => {
  if (data.ok) {
    data.json().then((newData) => {
      this.setState({
        currentShownAddress: newData.address,
        currentShownBalance: newData.final_balance,
        currentShownTxs: newData.txs
      });
    });
  } else {
    this.setState({
      currentShownAddress: "error"
    });
  }
});
```
